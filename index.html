        <h1>THE BOY FROM INDIA</h1>
        <p>I'm a boy from India , born in 2002 , named as SUMIT . Well , yes my name has a meaning and it means ' a good
            friend' . I studied at VP School since the very begining and studied there till I graduated without changing
            any school. I graduated from high school in 2019 being the topper of my school ( yeah , I'm kind of good at
            studies) . After that I started thinking of my career. As I thought I had to choose a field which matches my
            interests and I took decision of studying COMPUTER PROGRAMMING .
        </p>

        <p> INDIA BORN - As already mentioned , I was born in Rattanthal , Rewari , India on 11th of May 2002 . Being
            the 3rd chilD of my parents I was adored so much by my family. Having a prosper family backgroung I have
            never felt lack of anything . All of my wishes were fullfilled by my parents.
        </p>

        <p> SCHOOLS - The only school I studied in is VP Sr. Sec. School . The principl and the owner of the school both
            were friends with my father and had good relations so I never had any issues at school of any kind . Anyways
            , I was considered a good student . Talking about my scores I was topper of my class in the graduating year
            exams .
        </p>

        <p> ACHEIVMENTS - Well , I have won a number of prizes in high school during my studies but that's not what I
            call acheivements . What I consider as an acheivement is that I have created a good image of me in the
            society . Also , at the age of 20 , I have experienced being a teacher . I have worked with GAV Group of
            schools and VP school as a teacher where I was invited to play the role of English teacher . Working with
            all of my teachers as a colleague is what I call an acheivement .
        </p>

        <p> FUTURE GOALS - Talking about future is fascinating as well as scary for me . Fascinating as in the way I
            have dreams that I want to accomplish and talking about future makes me imagine me accomplishing my goals
            and scary in the way what if I can not accomplish what I have been dreaming for . Well , I feel like I am
            acheiving my goals step by step . The very first goal after graduating from high school was to get enrolled
            in a well recognised University or College and be independent that seems to be fullfilled now. The next goal
            is to be a sucessful student at Georgian College and be a sucessful Softare Engineer . </p>


        <p> ME AND COMPUTERS - My intouction to computers started in kinda interesting way . I am so fond of Marvel
            movies and a huge fan of Ironman . I used to watch all of the movies and I got curious about all the
            computer and technology stuff . I started looking more deep into it and got more interested . By the age I
            had to decide what kind of future I want , computers had affected me so deeply that I always wanted to be
            'the tech guy in the room' . Although I had to choose Physics , Chemistry and Maths as the main subjects in
            my high school( because of no availablity of computer subjects) . After graduating from high school I
            decided to be a computer programmer.
